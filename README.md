# SAFETY_MONITORING_ROBOT_FOR_COAL_MINE
Mining hazards endanger workers' health and lives, with long-term effects. Damaging gases emitted by mining operations pose a survival threat, pressuring the industry. To address this, we created a safety monitoring robot for coal mines. It wirelessly streams video from inaccessible or hazardous areas, enhancing safety. #MiningSafety #Robotics
